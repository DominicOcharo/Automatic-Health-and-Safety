# YOLOv8 Object Detection Model: Construction Site Safety

## Model Overview
This YOLOv8 object detection model is trained to recognize and detect 10 classes critical for construction site safety. The classes include:

- Hardhat
- Mask
- NO-Hardhat
- NO-Mask
- NO-Safety Vest
- Person
- Safety Cone
- Safety Vest
- Machinery
- Vehicle

Built on the YOLOv8s architecture, this model balances speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time safety monitoring.
